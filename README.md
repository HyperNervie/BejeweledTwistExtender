# BejeweledTwistExtender
Plugin system for Bejeweled Twist based on the <a href="https://github.com/PlatinumTeam/MBExtender-Legacy">MBExtender</a> that allows developers to add additional functionality to the game by writing plugins in native C++ code.

Includes several plugins:
- Counter-Clockwise Twisting, on right mouse button and enter (return) key
- Autosaving for Blitz and timed Challenges
- Support for 16:9, 21:9 and other (ultra)wide screen resolutions
- 3D acceleration fix
- Skull and Angel gem crash fixes
- EXPERIMENTAL: Multi-Twist (twisting while other gems are in motion, disabled by default)

All plugins that change gameplay can be toggled in a simple config file that is auto-created in the game folder.
